# ComplexGame

AIE complex game system

Particle system rendered on the GPU by compute shaders in OpenGL.

There are two compute shaders to chose for alpha blending of Additive or Premulitplied.
This is shown with the fire and smoke particles rendering on run.

NOTE:
This system needs Glad, glfw, glm which can be found in OpenGLFile.
Texture and ShaderProgram header files were not originally mine but was modified to work with the project.
stb_image.h was not coded by me.
There is a lib for the particle system in ParticleRedist file.
